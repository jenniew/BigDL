## Summary
 This example use a (pre-trained GloVe embedding) to convert word to vector,
 and uses it to train a CNN, LSTM or GRU text classification model on a 20 Newsgroup dataset
 with 20 different categories. CNN model can achieve around 96% accuracy after 2 or 3 epochs training.
 LSTM and GRU are a little difficult to train, which need more epochs to achieve the equivalent result.
(It was first described in: https://blog.keras.io/using-pre-trained-word-embeddings-in-a-keras-model.html)
## Data
* Embedding: 100-dimensional pre-trained GloVe embeddings of 400k words which trained on a 2014 dump of English Wikipedia.
* Training data: "20 Newsgroup dataset" which containing 20 categories and with totally 19997 texts.

## How to run this example:

If there is no [Pre-train GloVe word embeddings](http://nlp.stanford.edu/data/glove.6B.zip)
or [20 Newsgroup dataset](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs.cmu.edu/project/theo-20/www/data/news20.html) in
`/tmp/news20` directory with the following structure looks like:

```{r, engine='sh'}
$ [/tmp/news20]$ tree . -L 1
  .
  ├── 20news-19997.tar.gz
  └── glove.6B.zip
```

then running the flowing script would automatically download the data during the first run.

bigdl.sh would setup the essential environment for you and it would accept a spark-submit command as an input parameter.

```{r, engine='sh'}
        PYTHONHASHSEED=...
        BigDL_HOME=...
        SPARK_HOME=...
        MASTER=...
        PYTHON_API_ZIP_PATH=${BigDL_HOME}/dist/lib/bigdl-VERSION-python-api.zip
        BigDL_JAR_PATH=${BigDL_HOME}/dist/lib/bigdl-VERSION-jar-with-dependencies.jar
        PYTHONPATH=${PYTHON_API_ZIP_PATH}:$PYTHONPATH
        source ${BigDL_HOME}/dist/bin/bigdl.sh

        ${SPARK_HOME}/bin/spark-submit \
            --master ${MASTER} \
            --driver-cores 4  \
            --driver-memory 10g  \
            --total-executor-cores 4  \
            --executor-cores 4  \
            --executor-memory 20g \
            --conf spark.akka.frameSize=64 \
            --py-files ${PYTHON_API_ZIP_PATH},${BigDL_HOME}/pyspark/dl/models/textclassifier/textclassifier.py  \
            --jars ${BigDL_JAR_PATH} \
            --conf spark.driver.extraClassPath=${BigDL_JAR_PATH} \
            --conf spark.executor.extraClassPath=bigdl-VERSION-jar-with-dependencies.jar \
            --conf spark.executorEnv.PYTHONHASHSEED=${PYTHONHASHSEED} \
            ${BigDL_HOME}/pyspark/dl/models/textclassifier/textclassifier.py \
             --max_epoch 3
             --model cnn
```

* `--max_epoch` option can be used to set how many epochs the model to be trained

* `--model` option can be used to choose a model to be trained, three models are supported in this example,
which are `cnn`, `lstm` and `gru`, default is `cnn`

* `--batchSize` option can be used to set batch size, the default value is 128.

* `embedding_dim` option can be used to set the embedding size of word vector, the default value is 50.

To verify the accuracy, search "accuracy" from log:

```{r, engine='sh'}
   [Epoch 1 0/15964][Iteration 1][Wall Clock 0.0s]

   top1 accuracy is Accuracy(correct: 14749, count: 15964, accuracy: 0.9238912
      553244801)
```
